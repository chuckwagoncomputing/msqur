	<h3>How to use this site:</h3>
	<section>
		<h4>To add your MSQ file to share and view online:</h4>
		<p>Click on the upload button:</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial1" src="view/img/tutorial1.png"/>
		<p>Click the "Browse" button (or area) and select the MSQ file you want to upload. Note that you can upload more than one at a time, using the same engine information for each:</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial2" src="view/img/tutorial2.png"/>
		<p>Now enter in the engine information for the MSQ file(s):</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial3" src="view/img/tutorial3.png"/>
		<p>Click upload, and you should see links to your MSQ file(s) if successful. You can copy (right-click and select "Copy Link Location" or something like that), or click on it to view the file.</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial4" src="view/img/tutorial4.png"/>
		<p>Now you can browse the various sections of your MSQ file:</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial5" src="view/img/tutorial5.png"/>
		<p>Since I don't have the configuration files for every single Megasquirt version, you might see an error like this:</p>
		<img class="tutorial" id="tutorial6" src="view/img/tutorial6.png"/>

	<p>If so, please email me (n&#101;&#097;&#114;&#119;&#111;&#111;&#100;@gm&#097;&#105;&#108;.com) with your "INI" file (msqur tries to give you a hint as to the version it needs).</p>
