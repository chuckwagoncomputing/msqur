# rusEFI msqur branch strategy

We use master branch only to pull in upstream repository. We do not change master.

We create pull requests into upstream from dev branches. 

"prod" branch is what rusEFI uses in production. Any custom rusEfi code which we do not intend to push upstream
should live in this branch.
